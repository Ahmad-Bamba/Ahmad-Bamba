Hi, I'm Ahmad (@Ahmad-Bamba). I am a tenacious problem-solver who believes the journey to a solution is just as important as the conclusion.

My passion is working with low-level software, particularly in firmware design and embedded systems. As we move to a world of pervasive computing, the ability to design and implement software that runs on devices that are forced to run with limited resources and unconventional restrictions is a challenge that I find stimulating to work on.

I am a graduate from the Master's Program in Computer Science at the University of Chicago focused on software engineering, and an undergraduate from the University of Chicago in computer Science and physics. I have focused on building modern industry skillsets in C and C++, Java, device driver programming, Assembly (ARM and x86), computer architecture design, Object Oriented Programming, SQL and no-SQL databases, mathematics, algorithms and complexity theory, among others.

My latest work has been tied to machine learning systems, where I, on a small research system, designed a system of notifications designed to encourage the creation of fairer and more ethical machine learning models. I also implemented systems crucial to the evaluation of the success of this system, which included front-end, back-end, and database programming. I hope to use my experience working in restrictive, performance-sensitive research environments to bear in an embedded systems context.
